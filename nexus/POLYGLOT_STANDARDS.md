# Nexus Polyglot Engineering Standards

**Version:** 1.0.0-INSTITUTIONAL
**Goal:** Sub-millisecond Execution & Hardware-Bound Safety

To achieve "Top 1% in the World" performance, Nexus utilizes a multi-runtime satellite architecture. Each language is selected for its specific mathematical or operational profile.

## 🚀 The Satellite Matrix

| Runtime | Role | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rust** | Risk Engine | Memory-safe, zero-cost abstractions for complex VaR/ES simulations. |
| **Go** | Platform Auditor | Parallel goroutines for ultra-fast multi-service health verification. |
| **Zig** | Order Validator | Low-level C-like performance with modern safety for payload sanity. |
| **Python** | Neural Hub | Orchestration, high-level strategy logic, and AI integration. |

## 🛠️ Toolchain Deployment

The following compilers must be available on the production host:
- `rustc` / `cargo` (Latest stable)
- `go` (1.21+)
- `zig` (0.11+)

## 📡 Orchestration Pattern

Python acts as the **Control Plane**, while Rust/Go/Zig act as the **Data Plane**. Communication is handled via the `PolyglotBridge` using high-speed subprocess execution and optimized JSON serialization.
