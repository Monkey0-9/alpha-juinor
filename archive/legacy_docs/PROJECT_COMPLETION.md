## 3. Operational Guide
The system is currently running in the background.

### 🟢 Normal Operation
- **Logs**: Watch for `⚡ [SURVEILLANCE] Scanning...` (Updates every ~5s).
- **Logic**: It silently computes EVT/Markov probabilities.
- **Action**: It trades *only* when `EV > 0` and `Regime != Panic`.

### 🔴 Emergency Stop
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to freeze all trading.
- The `SafeMode` engages automatically if a 3% Flash Crash is detected.

## 4. Final Handover
The codebase is clean, tested, and optimized. No further code changes are required for operation.
**The "Mini Quant Fund" is now a Professional Trading System.**
